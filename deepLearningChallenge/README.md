## Deep Learning challenge is a challenge for market data prediction. The output has been set at continuous (regression problem) but it can be split in different category in order to become a classification problem. Provide result on the testData.csv file adding a new column for the prediction result or class, please also add a readme if necessary and change the name of your file for result.csv.

Notes: 
1/ For every day you can use data for that day or data previously available to predict Y but you can't use data posterior to that day.
2/ Dates (labels) can be an input in the sytem.
3/ The test period is provided with data ulterior to the prediction set, to be able to test out of sample. Further test period will be provided but on a day by day basis.
4/ Y for dates previous to the current date can also be an input in the system.
5/ Once the model is built, another set of testing data will be provided to testing it.
